        <p><strong>The project</strong></p>
        <p>This project is about making an online exhibition aiming to give visibility
          to women and non-binary people in tech and in computer science. Very often their contributions
          are overlooked or forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>That's why we want to explore possibilities in VR and in-browser 3D with
          JavaScript and <a href="https://aframe.io/">aframe.io</a>
          to exhibit the life, work, struggles and successes of these women and non-binary people.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
        <p>We are students from the university <a href="http://www.htw-berlin.de">HTW Berlin</a>. We have a limited time
          to bring this project to life. It will be very experimental and we hope
          it will be fun. Stay tuned :D
        </p>

        <p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
        <p>Our goal is to find an intersectional group of women and non-binary people in computer science
          to portrait. If you know a person that we should portrait please contact
          us and tell us the name and if possible a link with more information.
